A program that uses everything I learned in comp 163, including custom exceptions, file usage, modules, classes, recursion, methods, and user engagement. It collects information from two different users, and has an interactive terminal. Based on the inputs of both users and the inputs in the terminal, it advises coaches, through a pdf file created with pypdf2, whether a player should make their team.

Input values: 

Output values: 

Output format: 
PDF file that gives tests passed/failed and reccomendation for status on the team. 
Prompts that guide the user through the HTML-formatted site. 

User engagement strategy: 
Use an HTML site to allow both recruits and coaches to use the system efficiently.
Simple color themes, simple prompts, options to revise at multiple checkpoints. 

Coding goals/challenges: 
Develop a proficient and holistic understanding of Python. 
Utilize recursive submethods. 
Optimize user engagement. 
Use try/except blocks alongside recursion to prevent bugs/breaks.
Become familiar with commonly used modules. 
Combine scripts from various languages for a complete project. 
HTML formatting a pdf within a Python file running on an HTML file.
